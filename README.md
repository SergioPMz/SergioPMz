# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sergio Pina MartÃ­nez

ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying multiplatform app development at SAN ANTONIO FP in Murcia, Spain.

## ðŸš€ Projects

In this github account I have the following projects available on public repositories.

- ðŸ”¢ [**Sudoku Solver (Binary & Decimal)**](https://github.com/SergioPMz/Java-Sudoku-Solver)  
  A Sudoku puzzle solver that supports both binary and decimal versions of the game. The program currently takes the sudokus from specific webs that generate them and when the solution is found it inserts the solution back into the web. This is a more efficient and organized version of a sudoku solver I coded to learn java basics around the second half of 2024. 

- â™Ÿ [**Chess Game**](https://github.com/SergioPMz/Java-Chess)  
  A simple implementation of a chess game built entirely in Java. I did this project this summer purely to practice my programming skills.
  
## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

I'm currently focused on improving my skills in:

- Java and object-oriented programming  
- Algorithm design and problem-solving  
- Data structures and clean code practices  
- Exploring new programming languages and technologies

Thanks for visiting my GitHub!
